Restart ST-3....

Currentlly it add the following commands:

*'copy_path' command (no key binding set.... use command pallete) that copies the path to the file in the active window into the clipboard.

*'command_log' command can enable/disable/toggle logging commands to the console. 
args: 
*"enable"(bool) true to enable, false to disable
*"toggle"(bool) true to toggle (igores the enabled arg)
